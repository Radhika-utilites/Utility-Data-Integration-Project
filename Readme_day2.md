📘 Day 2 – Environment Setup (Login and Access Configuration)
✅ Today’s Progress

Set up and logged in to all tools required for my Utility Data Integration Project.

| Tool | Status | Notes |
|-----|------|--------|
| **Snowflake** | Logged in successfully | Free trial account created and activated. Yet to create DB, Schema, and Warehouse.|
| **AWS S3** | Logged in successfully  | Will create bucket and folders in next step.|
| **Informatica IICS** | Logged in successfully  | Trial access activated. Installed secure agent|

🧩 What I Did Today

Signed up for Snowflake trial (Enterprise on AWS).

Signed up and logged in to AWS Console.

Logged into Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS) trial successfully.

Verified IICS home, Projects section, and Administrator page access.

🗓️ Plan for Next Day (Day 3)

Create Snowflake Database, Schema, Warehouse, and Sample Table.

Create AWS S3 Bucket and folder structure (input, output).

create basic connections (SQL Server, S3, Snowflake).

Validate connectivity between all tools.

🧠 Key Learnings

Snowflake runs on cloud region-based warehouses (will use Mumbai region).

AWS S3 will act as staging for IICS–Snowflake integration.

IICS allows creating multiple environments under one project — will use this to manage dev/test jobs.

🏁 Status

Completed account setup and initial access successfully.

Next: start with environment configuration and first mapping setup (sql → flatfile).
